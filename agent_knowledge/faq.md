# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** What are your core technical skills?
**A:** My core skills include Python, FastAPI, Django, React, Node.js, AWS, Docker, and integrating AI/ML models into production systems. I have deep experience with REST APIs, cloud deployments, and automation. I'm particularly strong in building scalable backend systems and modern web applications that handle real-world production traffic.

**Q:** How many years of experience do you have?
**A:** I have 4+ years of professional software development experience, having worked at companies like Veritis Group, TCS, and Virtusa. My experience spans from junior developer roles to senior positions where I've led critical projects. I've built everything from healthcare APIs to financial systems, gaining expertise across multiple domains.

**Q:** Can you describe a time you solved a critical production issue?
**A:** At Veritis, I diagnosed and resolved a healthcare API outage in under 30 minutes, restoring service for 5,000+ users. I used log analysis, rapid rollback, and coordinated with DevOps to minimize downtime. The issue was traced to a memory leak in our ML model inference pipeline, which I fixed by implementing proper resource cleanup.

**Q:** How do you ensure code quality and reliability?
**A:** I use automated testing (unit, integration, E2E), CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and static analysis tools. At TCS, I improved test coverage from 55% to 82% and reduced bugs by 25%. I also implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, and alerting to catch issues before they impact users.

**Q:** What is your experience with AI/ML in production?
**A:** I've built and deployed multiple ML systems in production, including real-time prediction APIs at Veritis that handle 25K+ daily inferences with <200ms response time. I've worked with diagnosis risk scoring models, automated training pipelines, and model versioning systems. My experience includes both traditional ML and modern LLM-based applications.

**Q:** How do you handle cloud cost optimization?
**A:** I reduced AWS costs by 30% at TCS by containerizing workloads, implementing auto-scaling, and monitoring usage with CloudWatch. I also optimized database queries, implemented efficient caching strategies, and used spot instances for non-critical workloads. Cost monitoring and optimization is something I consider from the design phase of every project.

**Q:** How do you approach mentoring junior developers?
**A:** I have mentored 8+ junior developers, providing regular code reviews, pair programming sessions, and training on best practices in API design, testing, and DevOps. I believe in hands-on mentoring where I guide them through real project challenges. I also create documentation and knowledge sharing sessions to help the entire team grow.

**Q:** What is your approach to security and compliance?
**A:** I follow best practices for authentication, authorization, and data encryption in all projects. For healthcare projects at Veritis, I ensured HIPAA compliance and implemented regular security audits. I use tools like OAuth, JWT tokens, and secure API design patterns. Security is never an afterthought but built into the architecture from day one.

**Q:** How do you handle project deadlines and pressure?
**A:** I prioritize tasks using frameworks like MoSCoW, break down work into manageable sprints, and communicate proactively with stakeholders about progress and blockers. In high-pressure situations, I focus on critical path items and deliver incremental value. I've successfully delivered multiple projects under tight deadlines while maintaining code quality.

**Q:** What are your most impactful projects?
**A:** My most impactful projects include the real-time clinical decision support tool at Veritis that processes 25K+ daily medical predictions, the full-stack loan platform at TCS that automated risk assessment, and the event-driven data processing pipeline that improved performance by 40%. Each project delivered measurable business value and technical innovation.

**Q:** What is your experience with different programming languages?
**A:** I'm most proficient in Python and JavaScript, with 4+ years of professional experience in both. I also have solid experience with Java, C#, and TypeScript. I've used C and C++ for system-level programming and have working knowledge of SQL for database operations. My language choice depends on the project requirements and team preferences.

**Q:** How do you stay updated with new technologies?
**A:** I continuously learn through online courses, having completed certifications in Advanced Learning Algorithms (Stanford), AI (IBM), and Deep Learning (Coursera). I also contribute to open-source projects, follow tech blogs, and participate in developer communities. I believe in hands-on learning by building side projects with new technologies.

**Q:** What is your experience with microservices and distributed systems?
**A:** I've designed and implemented microservices architectures using FastAPI and Django, with proper service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. At Veritis, I built event-driven systems using AWS Lambda and SQS that handle high-volume data processing. I understand the challenges of distributed systems including consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

**Q:** How do you approach system design and architecture?
**A:** I start with understanding the business requirements and constraints, then design systems that prioritize scalability, maintainability, and performance. I use design patterns like MVC, Repository, and Factory patterns. I also consider non-functional requirements like security, monitoring, and deployment from the beginning. Documentation and clear API contracts are essential parts of my design process.

**Q:** What is your experience with React and frontend development?
**A:** I have strong experience with React, TypeScript, and modern frontend technologies. I've built responsive web applications using React with Redux for state management, integrated with REST APIs, and implemented real-time features using WebSockets. I focus on creating user-friendly interfaces that provide excellent user experience while maintaining code quality.

**Q:** How do you handle database design and optimization?
**A:** I have experience with both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases. I design normalized schemas, implement proper indexing strategies, and optimize queries for performance. At TCS, I implemented PostgreSQL triggers and stored procedures for automated business logic. I also understand database scaling patterns like sharding and replication.

**Q:** What is your experience with DevOps and CI/CD?
**A:** I've implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions. I containerize applications using Docker and have experience with Kubernetes for orchestration. I set up monitoring and logging using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack. I believe in infrastructure as code and have used Terraform for AWS deployments.

**Q:** How do you approach testing and quality assurance?
**A:** I follow test-driven development (TDD) principles and write comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. I use pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript, and Selenium for UI testing. I also implement API testing using Postman and automated testing in CI/CD pipelines. Quality is everyone's responsibility, not just QA's.

**Q:** What is your experience with working in agile teams?
**A:** I've worked in agile environments using Scrum and Kanban methodologies. I participate actively in sprint planning, daily standups, retrospectives, and sprint reviews. I believe in collaborative development, regular feedback, and iterative improvement. I've worked with cross-functional teams including designers, product managers, and QA engineers.

**Q:** How do you handle technical debt and legacy code?
**A:** I approach technical debt strategically by identifying high-impact areas and gradually refactoring while maintaining functionality. I document technical debt, prioritize it based on business impact, and plan refactoring as part of regular development cycles. I've successfully modernized legacy systems by implementing proper testing, breaking down monoliths, and updating dependencies.

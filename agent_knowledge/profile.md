Venkateswara Narra
Software Development Engineer @ Veritis Group Inc | Master of
Science
Coppell, Texas, United States
Summary
I’m a full stack developer who enjoys building real-world applications
that are both smart and reliable. Over the past few years, I’ve
worked on projects across healthcare, finance, and retail—handling
everything from backend APIs and data pipelines to frontend
dashboards and ML integrations. I like working across the stack
and figuring out how all the pieces fit together to make things work
smoothly.
I recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science at George
Mason University, where I got to dive deeper into system design, AI,
and hands-on software architecture. I'm always exploring new tools,
learning by building, and staying curious about what’s next in tech.

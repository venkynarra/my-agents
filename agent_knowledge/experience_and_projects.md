# Professional Experience

## Veritis Group Inc. - Software Development Engineer (Recent Work)
As part of my current role, my primary focus has been the development of a sophisticated, AI-powered testing agent. This is my most recent major project. The agent is designed for end-to-end platform validation, covering user flows, endpoint health checks, and UI automation. My key contributions include designing the hierarchical test tree architecture, implementing parallel test execution to reduce runtime by 40%, and developing a comprehensive logging system. A standout feature is the AI-driven response verification, where I leveraged an LLM to generate expected API outputs and flag anomalies, significantly improving bug detection rates.

## TCS - Full-Stack Developer (Feb 2021 - June 2022)
During my time at TCS, I was instrumental in developing a full-stack loan platform. My responsibilities included designing and implementing machine learning scoring APIs using Django and integrating them with credit bureau data to automate loan risk classification. The platform featured LSTM models for time-series trend prediction and Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic risk modeling. On the frontend, I used React and TypeScript to build a responsive user interface for loan processing workflows.

# Previous Project Details & Certifications

1. AIPowered Testing Agent Development 

Architecture & Core Features: Designed a Pythonbased testing agent capable of endtoend platform validation—covering user flows, endpoint health checks, and UI automation. 

FlowTree & Endpoint Testing: Implemented hierarchical test trees to model and traverse all major user journeys; built generic endpoint testers for any REST/GraphQL interface. 

Performance Optimization: Introduced parallel test execution, reduced average test runtime by 40%, and integrated adaptive retry logic. 

Logging & Audit Trail: Developed comprehensive, timestamped logging aligned with Veritis standards; logs include request/response payloads and performance metrics. 

AI Response Verification: Leveraged an LLM to generate expected outputs for key API calls, comparing them to actual responses and flagging anomalies. 

Reporting & Notifications: Automated generation of PDF reports (with embedded logs and timestamps) and optional email delivery to stakeholders upon test completion. 

2. Certifications & Training 

Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera | DeepLearning.AI) 
• Completed all three courses (Apr 28, 2025) under Andrew Ng's instruction. 
• Covered supervised learning (linear/logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, anomaly detection), recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. 
• Gained handson experience applying ML best practices to realworld datasets (e.g. housing prices, image classification). 
• Implemented end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, ScikitLearn). 

Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 60 Days, Build 20 Apps (Udemy) 
• Completed 52 hours of guided training (Mar–May 2025), progressing from beginner to advanced topics. 
• Mastered core Python concepts, objectoriented design, debugging, Git workflows, SQL databases, API integration, web scraping, automation with Selenium, data visualization, and packaging. 
• Built and deployed 20+ projects, including desktop GUIs (Tkinter), web apps (Flask, Streamlit, Django), REST APIs, and automation scripts. 
• Practiced CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions, unit testing with pytest, and deployment to Heroku/AWS for production readiness.

Each repository includes comprehensive README docs, automated unit/integration tests, CI/CD pipelines, and code coverage badges. 

4. Impact & Outcomes 

Reduced manual testing effort by 60% and initial bug discovery turned up 25% earlier in the development cycle. 

Improved overall test coverage across core modules from 55% to 82%. 

Streamlined reporting process, enabling faster stakeholder visibility and decisionmaking. 

5. MultiModel AI Chat Platform & RAG Integration 

MultiModel Chat Application: Developed an interactive CLI/terminalUI chat app supporting Google Gemini, Cohere, and Mistral models with: 

Smart model switching, automatic fallback, retry logic, and error recovery. 

Rich commands (/help, /stats, /compare, /switch, /save) with integrated performance metrics and comparison. 

Terminalbased UI using Rich and detailed performance visualization. 

CLI for Model Comparison: Built a standalone commandline tool to compare responses across the three AI models from scratch for any user prompt. 

RAG Integration UI: Implemented a web UI and backend (FastAPI + SQLite) to retrieve and render tablebased data from Salesforce and ServiceNow—enabling users to execute RAG queries and view results in real time. 

Advanced AI FineTuning & Caching: Integrated PEFT (LoRA & QLoRA) on transformer models, implemented request caching, and added data visualization dashboards. 

RLHF Roadmap: Designed the framework for future RLHF integration on the RAG platform to refine model output quality.
